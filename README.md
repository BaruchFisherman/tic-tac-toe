We have a little basic tic-tac-toe written in react with tests for some components and for the reducers and utils functions.

The colors are chosen random, as the players order.

For styling I have used BEM methodology.

I have included a .mov file - video demo

Requirements: node v10.13.0 (sice the latest react and react-dom need it)

To start: npm start
